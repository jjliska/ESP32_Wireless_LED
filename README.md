# ESP32_Wireless_Communication_LED
Uses ESPnow to communicate between two ESP32's for use in use of physically separated objects.

## Concept of Research
&ensp;The concept for this was to create a slave-master system using the ESP-32 and the ESPnow library to allow two devices to communcate with eachother. This would allow information in any byte format to be passed between the devices as well as allowing two way communication as well as communication with other devices. Hypothetically this could be used with far more devices as long as they are linked via mac address and one is acting as a host for the others or they all act as a master and slave for another platform.

## Future Designs and Continuation
&ensp;This concept could easily be integrated into a wearable device or many wearable devices to tell specific local data; such as body temperature, heart rate, and other bodily functions. One could also create a brilliant light suit or some sort of astetic piece for a costume that communicates light signals or auditory information from one piece to another.
